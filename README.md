<h1>WindowsGPT</h1>


I am developing an interactive chat for Windows that allows users to write commands in natural language, like "Hello, please open the calculator".
The system interprets these requests and, through a bot, automatically generates the necessary code to open the requested application, such as the calculator, 
browsers, or the control panel. This bot not only generates the code but also compiles and executes it directly, making it easier to interact with the operating system through simple textual commands.

---

The chat requires an OpenAI ChatGPT key to process the instructions and generate the code that performs the requested action. 

The main goal of the project is to simplify interaction with the system, enabling users to perform complex actions with simple commands.

This is an ambitious project in its early stages, with a focus on evolving and expanding its functionality.
